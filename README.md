# Router Kit

Router Kit is meant to be a toolkit for building custom routing solutions for front-end, single page web applications.  It provides a simple, middleware-based architecture for handling `window.location` changes.  Router Kit does not include any particular implementation for tracking location changes, so you'll likely want to use a library like [history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/history) for that.

## Getting Started

Install via `npm`:

```
npm install --save @helpfulhuman/router-kit
```
